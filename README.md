# To Play, download Build.zip, unpack and run the "Smile Together.exe"

Many virtual pets have been developed over the years, especially since the dawn of smartphones. 
Each of these games have their own unique playstyle, some focus on playing minigames with your pet 
while others allow you to dress up your companion. 
Others still allow you to pit your buddy against that of other players in battle! 
The core mechanic that unites all these various games is the acquiring of and general caring for some kind of pet, 
be it an animal, a monster,  or otherwise! 
Smile Together will include all the usual aspects of a virtual pet: 
feeding it, checking on its condition, etc., 
but the pet will also have a variety of moods and emotions that affect how it interacts with the user.
